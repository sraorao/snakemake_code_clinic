Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	count_lines
	1

rule count_lines:
    input: jabberwocky.txt
    output: count.txt
    jobid: 0

[Tue Oct 20 20:00:33 2020]
Error in rule count_lines:
    jobid: 0
    output: count.txt
    shell:
        cat jabberwocky.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | grep -oP '([a-z])+' | sort > count.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job count_lines since they might be corrupted:
count.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
