Lints for snakefile /home/srao/PycharmProjects/testing_one/Snakefile:
    * Absolute path "/home/srao/PycharmProjects/testing_one" in line 1:
      Do not define absolute paths inside of the workflow, since this renders your workflow irreproducible on other machines.
      Use path relative to the working directory instead, or make the path configurable via a config file.

Lints for rule generate_files (line 5, /home/srao/PycharmProjects/testing_one/Snakefile):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In distributed environments, this means that errors
      are harder to discover. In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become unreadable.

      https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#log-files
    * Specify a conda environment or container for each rule.:
      This way, the used software for each specific step is documented, and the workflow can be executed on any machine without
      prerequisites.
